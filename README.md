This is a side project built during my Full Stack Developement program at Lambda School. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to log into their bank accounts and track their expenses through one application instead of having all of their information on seperate banking apps. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding Redux for state management and on the server-side I used Node.js and Express.

In the next iteration I plan on completing the application
